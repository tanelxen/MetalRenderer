Simple game engine was written with Swift and Metal in just fun purposes.
Heavy inspired Id-Tech and Valve engines.

Features:

- ✅ Loading Quake 3 .bsp
- ✅ Own assets format for skinned meshes
- ✅ Importer from GoldSrc .mdl
- ✅ Skeletal animation
- ✅ Brush based collision detection
- ✅ Quake-style player movement
- ✅ AI navigation with waypoints and A\*\
- ✅ Ambient lightning for skeletal meshes (light grid)
- ✅ Sandbox editor based on ImGUI
- ✅ Simple particles (CPU driven)
- ✅ Decals on static geometry

## NOTE
At this moment the code doesn't look good because I'm experimenting with some techniques and trying to find out better way.
Don't take it as production ready game engine. It's just my playground. However, I seek to stay code quite straightforward and understandable.
Later I'm going to refactor all of that. And then perhaps it will be useful for someone.

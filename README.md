- ✅ Brush based collision detection
- ✅ Quake-style player movement

## NOTE
At this moment the code doesn't look good because I'm experimenting with some techniques and trying to find out better way.
Don't take it as production ready game engine. It's just my playground. However, I seek to stay code quite straightforward and understandable.
Later I'm going to refactor all of that. And then perhaps it will be useful for someone.

## TODO
- [ ] Integrate Recast for navmesh generating
- [ ] Improve navigation system
- [ ] Support Half-Life 2 models and maps
- [ ] Own assets format (maybe based on json)
- [ ] Material system
- [ ] Blending skeletal animations
- [ ] Rendering UI (besides crosshair)
- [ ] Refactoring all this stuff
